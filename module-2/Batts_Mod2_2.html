        <h2>Chapter 1: HTML</h2>

<p class="intro"> My name is Darlene and I have lived my entire life in North Carolina. I have always loved figuring out how things work. When I was young, I would tear down various electronics just to see how they were put together(This did not please my parents!).</p>

<p>I gratuated high school and soon after was married with my first child.  I didn't go back and graduate from college with a AAS degree in Computer Sciences until 17 years later. I have since gone back many times for random classes as I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies.</p>

<p><span class="sentence">I am married to my first love.</span> I fell in love with him when I was 14 years old....he did NOT feel the same at that time and told me later that though he thought I was cute, I was very annoying.(I get that alot.) He changed his mind a few years later and we briefly dated when I was 17 and he was 18.  Sadly, it didn't last very long as he was enlisted in the Navy. 17 years later, our paths crossed once more and he asked me out.  I told him, no as I was over dating anyone else.  He convinced me to go out as friends....That was 12 years ago.  We will celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary this coming October.</p>

<p>I have taken HTML and CSS before, and yet I barely remember the course. I hope to do better this time. It is true what they say, "If you don't use it, you lose it."</p>
